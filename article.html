		<h1>PWA, so hot right now!</h1>
		<div class="wrapper">
			<p class="chapo">« Progressive Web Apps » are making a lot of noise lately. Ever heard of it? Let me introduce you to what Google is pushing to be the next standard for Apps.</p>

			<p>Let's say we have build together a beautiful website (probably about cats). It's great and people love it! But then we are getting some peculiar feedbacks:</p>
			<blockquote>- "I love this site, but it would be better if it was an app..."</blockquote>
			<p>We made our site fully responsive so it displays nice and smooth on every devices. So why would people want it to be an app?</p>
			<h2>Mobile App vs Website</h2>
			<p>Well, first of all, apps are easilly accessible. They're usually one click away on a shortcut on the splashscreen of your phone. Let's face it, would we be checking Facebook so compulsively if we had to open the browser and write the address every time?</p>
			<p>They also display in their own window. Meaning you can put it in the background and come back to it later. Of course, you can do the same with the tabs of your browser, but who does that on a phone, right?</p>
			<p>More than that, Apps are always usable, even when you are offline. Of course, the content might not be up to date. But you never have an error screen asking you to turn your wifi on.</p>
			<p>And, if you still need to be convinced, with an App we can send notifications to our users every time we post a new picture of a cute cat! Does that not sound great?</p>
			<h2>Building an App - The old way</h2>
			<p>Ok, so, how do we make an App? Well we first need to decide which platform! Android or iOs? Probably both, right?</p>
			<p>That means two different projects. For Android, we'll have to write the App in Java or Kotlin, while we'll probably use Swift for iOs. Wow, that sounds like a lot of work!</p>
			<p>But the saddest thing about this is that we won't be able to reuse all the work we've done for the website.</p>
			<h2>PWA for the win</h2>
			<p>That's where Progressive Web Apps come in! With PWA, you just turn your website into an App. It will feels like an App, but it will still be build on web technologies (HTML, CSS, ...).</p>
			<p>When visiting the website, people will be welcomed by a pop-up asking them if they want to install the app. By clicking them, it will add a shortcut to their phone. No need to go through the App Store any more. Our website will then be displayed in its own window, just like any other app!</p>
			<p>PWA uses caching to serve our pages even when the user is offline. People can now satisfy their needs for cute kittens without burning their data plan. And with the use of Service Worker, they get notifications for any new content. What a dream!</p>
			<h2>There is more to say...</h2>
			<p>I won't be able to write about the details of how to make a Progressive Web App. It would be too long and, to be honest, this is an area I am still discovering.</p>
			<p>I'm hoping you will find this topic as interesting as I do. I'm adding a few links if you want to have a look deeper. Cheers!</p>
