		<h1>Introducing me</h1>
		<div class="wrapper">
			<p>Hi, I'm Max. My full name is Maxime Gaj, but it usually is easier with Max. I currently lives in Li√®ge (Luik). I'm 29, but will turn 30 on the 1st of September! It's too bad that the Java Academy will begin on the 2nd, one day earlier I would have brought cake...</p>
			<p>I've been working for the past two years as a freelance web developer. My comfort zone is around PHP (symfony) and Javascript (Node, React). I identify as a back-end developer, but as a freelancer, I had to learn the full stack.</p>
			<p>Coding has been my main passion for a long time. Even when I was not working in IT, most of my free time was dedicated to learning something new. Last year, I have been granted a scholarship and graduated from the <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/QLNQDYMD">Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity</a>.</p>
			<p>When I am not around my computer, I enjoy life with my beautiful wife, our cute black norvegian cat and our two funny little feathered velociraptors (also known as chicken). We recently got our first eggs, yay!</p>
			<p>All together, we will enjoy simple things: a good book, a walk in the countryside, a play of chess (the cat is not very good, though). But for my alone times, I still have a decently filled Steam account.</p>
			<p>I'm getting hyped over the beginning of the Java Academy! I'm looking forward to meeting you all. See you soon!</p>
