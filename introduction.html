		<h1>Introducing me</h1>
		<div class="wrapper">

			<p>Hi, I'm Max. My full name is Maxime Gaj, but it usually is easier with Max. I currently lives in Liège (Luik). I'm 29, but will turn 30 on the 1st of September! It's too bad that the Java Academy will begin on the 2nd, one day earlier I would have brought cake...</p>
			<p>I've been working for the past two years as a freelance web developer. My comfort zone is around PHP (symfony) and Javascript (Node, React). I identify as a back-end developer, but as a freelancer, I had to learn the full stack.</p>
			<p>Coding has been my main passion for a long time. Even when I was not working in IT, most of my free time was dedicated to learning something new. Last year, I have been granted a scholarship and graduated from the <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/QLNQDYMD">Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity</a>.</p>
			<p>When I am not around my computer, I enjoy life with my beautiful wife, our cute black norvegian cat and our two funny little chickens. We recently got our first eggs, yay!</p>
			<p>All together, we will enjoy simple things: a good book, a walk in the countryside, a play of chess (the cat is not very good, though). But for my alone times, I still have a decently filled Steam account.</p>
			<p>I'm getting hyped over the beginning of the Java Academy! I'm looking forward to meeting you all. See you soon!</p>
